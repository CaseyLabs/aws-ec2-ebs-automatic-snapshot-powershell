## POWERSHELL: Automatic EBS Volume Snapshot Creation & Clean-Up Script
#
# Written by Casey Labs Inc. (http://www.caseylabs.com)

#
# PURPOSE: This Powershell script can be used to take automatic snapshots of your Windows EC2 instance. Script process:
# - Determine the instance ID of the EC2 server on which the script runs
# - Gather a list of all volume IDs attached to that instance
# - Take a snapshot of each attached volume
# - The script will then delete all associated snapshots taken by the script that are older than 7 days

#
# NON-LEGAL MUMBO-JUMBO DISCLAIMER: Hey, this script deletes snapshots (though only the ones that it creates)!

## SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:
#
## IAM USER:
#
# This script requires that a new user (e.g. ebs-snapshot) be created in the IAM section of AWS. 
# Here is a sample IAM policy for AWS permissions that this new user will require:
#
#{
#  "Statement": [
#    {
#      "Sid": "Stmt1345661449962",
#      "Action": [
#        "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
#        "ec2:DeleteSnapshot",
#        "ec2:CreateTags",
#        "ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
#        "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
#        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
#        "ec2:DescribeSnapshotAttribute",
#        "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
#        "ec2:DescribeVolumeAttribute",
#        "ec2:DescribeVolumeStatus",
#        "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
#        "ec2:ReportInstanceStatus",
#        "ec2:ResetSnapshotAttribute"
#      ],
#      "Effect": "Allow",
#      "Resource": [
#        "*"
#      ]
#    }
#  ]
#}

## AWS CLI:
# This script requires the AWS CLI tools to be installed on the target Windows instance.
# Download the Windows installer for AWS CLI at: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
# 
# Next, configure AWS CLI by opening a command prompt on the Window server and running this command: 
#		aws configure
#
# Access Key & Secret Access Key: enter in the credentials generated above for the new IAM user
# Region Name: the region that this instance is currently in.
# Output Format: enter "text"

## SETUP SCRIPT SCHEDULED TASK
#
# Copy this script to your chosen location (e.g. C:\aws\ebs-snapshot.ps1)
#
# Next, create a batch file in the same directory (e.g. C:\aws\run-backup.cmd)
# Edit run-backup.cmd and enter these commands (with the appropriate local admin name and file locations, and without the #'s):
#
# set USERPROFILE=C:\Users\Administrator\
# powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -file "C:\aws\ebs-snapshot.ps1"
#
# Save the file. [Why do we have this separate batch script? Because in Windows 2012, the Task Scheduler passes the Default User environment
# variables, and therefore can't get the admin user's AWS credentials.]
#
# Next, open Task Scheduler on the server, and create a new task that runs C:\aws\run-backup.cmd on a nightly basis.
