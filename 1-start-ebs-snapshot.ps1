## POWERSHELL: EBS Automatic Snapshot - DISKSHADOW Component
#
# DISKSHADOW Script written by phiber232 (http://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/2hn57i/anyone_with_a_windows_server_on_ec2_how_are_you/ckvhfkx)
# Updated for Windows 2008 compatibility by Casey Labs Inc.
#
# PURPOSE: This script starts the diskshadow process to preserve disk consistency, then calls the EBS volume snapshot script. Process:
# - Gather a list of all local disks that are not S3 instances stores (i.e. "Temporary Storage").
# - Start diskshadow on each local disk.
# - Call the EBS snapshot script, and snapshot each volume.
# - End the diskshadow process, allowing writes to the disk again.
